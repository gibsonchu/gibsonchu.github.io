                <p class="project-description-heading">Overview</p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    <a href="https://www.hustle.com/" target="_blank">Hustle</a> is a peer to peer (1:1) messaging platform to help maintain relationships between the 
                    organizations and their contacts. This provides one-to-one engagement, improving effective marketing and efficient communication goals.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    During my time at Hustle, I worked with the Product & Design team as a Product Manager Intern. The main focus for the team that summer, or Q2 and Q3 2018, was revamping the “goal creation” process for new and existing users on both the web and mobile app. When I was brought on, I had no specific project assigned to me, so I personally reviewed some of the problems I saw with the product after reading all the help articles and going through the product myself, testing it as if I was one of the three different types of users — org admins, org agents, and contacts. 
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    A few projects I worked on include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Shipping out 2 new features as part of the “goal creation” process with the product and engineering team with React, Java, and Objective C — then following up with QA and the Client Success team to draft support articles to teach users how to use the features.</li>
                    <li>Conducting 500 user research sessions through surveys, phone calls, and in-person interviews to test usability of mobile iOS applications, specifically on the iPad and iPhones — then decking an internal presentation showcasing findings.</li>
                    <li>Creating a machine learning data regression model with the data team to help model spikes and forecast product usage during the election cycle (as many campaigns use Hustle as an outreach tool) — then relaying this information in a report for the Client Success team to be transparent with our customers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="project-description">
                    However, I’d like to focus on my contribution to the redesign in the interface workflow of its web texting platform for “goal creation,” drafting a hi-fidelity in Sketch before creating a mockup with CSS and Node.js. 
                </p>
                <p class="project-description-heading">Goal Creation Features</p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    The goal creation process for Hustle is as follows:
                </p>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>Set a measurable goal for a campaign, tracking message impact, event attendance, funding, or re-engagement of contacts.</li>
                    <li>Create an initial customizable script, making it easier for orgs to talk with contacts.</li>
                    <li>Start texting contacts.</li>
                </ol>

                    <p class="project-image-descrip">Some of the features Hustle offers.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="project-description">
                    A few components that I considered improving on was restructuring the reproducibility of goals, integrating with other apps like Google Calendar to better manage event texting, or creating a script bank that organizations could share across campaigns.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    I decided to focus on the last component — creating a script bank. Yet I quickly learned that this feature, while useful, would not be feasible due to time constraints. Thus, a simpler feature to add was an “Additional Response Scripts” that would come at the end of each goal creation.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description-heading">Additional Response Scripts</p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    At the beginning of each product feature, I would write out a spec, outlining all of my thoughts for how the project would move forward, establishing my motivations, questions, desired outcomes, OKRs, methodology, target audience, and existing data.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    This specific project was no different, outlining the thought process admins would have while creating goals and the importance of having an additional response script feature, or an automatic default additional response script.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    Due to non-disclosure agreements, I'm unable to share any more details about my work. Please contact me if you'd like to learn more about my process and I’d be more than happy to talk!

                <p class="project-description-heading">Takeaways</p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    Overall, this opportunity gave me a chance to push out real product features that affected a user’s workflow while allowing me the interact with customers to perform user research on how certain key components should be improved, backing that up with data analytics. 
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">It also gave me the chance to accurately work across various teams and the necessary communications required to impact-fully support what one group needed over another. Finally, I also learned how use machine learning to create usage forecasts to help prepare the client success team for high-usage counts, effectively preventing software downtime and overloads.
