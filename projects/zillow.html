                <p class="project-description">
                    The purpose of my consulting project was to research the potential applications of blockchain technology for <a href="https://www.zillowgroup.com/" target="_blank">Zillow Group</a> to enhance both user experience and increase internal efficiency. Our final report to the executive C-Suite targeted three different points: 
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Define what blockchain and cryptocurrency technology is.</li>
                    <li>Build case studies for how blockchain technology is used in various industries, including real estate.</li>
                    <li>Recommend whether Zillow Group would benefit, or not, from adopting this technology.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="project-description">
                    While I cannot go into specifics, these were the topics I focused my final report and deliverable deck on. Since the executive team did not know much about blockchain, the midterm deliverable focused on providing background and research heavy-focused information, whereas the second half was my team’s recommendation on Zillow Group’s resources were best spent.
                </p>

                <p class="project-description">
                    I built five different case studies that used blockchain in social media, finance, cybersecurity, consumer retail, and real estate — focusing on multiple listing services, smart contracts, and smart identities. Each of these case studies utilized a different component of a blockchain’s unique architecture for a secure and transparent platform, while also discussing some of the downfalls implementing blockchain would have.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    The final product was a 30-page detailed feasibility report and digestible presentation with clear self-created diagrams/graphics containing background specs and statistics showcasing some of the qualitative data on how beneficial and hurtful blockchain would be.

                <p class="project-description">
                    Overall, the project gave me chance to work with a new, popular technology blockchain and understand its current implementations in a variety of industries. Thus, I was able to determine a solid recommendation for what I believed would be the most effective solution for Zillow Group to improve its financial transactions and user experience.
